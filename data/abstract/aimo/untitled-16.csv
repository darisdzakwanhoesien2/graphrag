  Inference Scaling","Zhenyu Hou, Xin Lv, Rui Lu, Jiajie Zhang, Yujiang Li, Zijun Yao, Juanzi Li, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong",arXiv (Cornell University),2025,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches mainly rely on imitation learning and struggle to achieve effective test-time scaling. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for enabling self-exploration and learning from feedback, recent attempts yield only modest improvements in complex reasoning. In this paper, we present T1 to scale RL by encouraging exploration and understand inference scaling. We first initialize the LLM using synthesized chain-of-thought data that integrates trial-and-error and self-verification. To scale RL training, we promote increased sampling diversity through oversampling. We further employ an entropy bonus as an auxiliary loss, alongside a dynamic anchor for regularization to facilitate reward optimization. We demonstrate that T1 with open LLMs as its base exhibits inference scaling behavior and achieves superior performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. For example, T1 with Qwen2.5-32B as the base model outperforms the recent Qwen QwQ-32B-Preview model on MATH500, AIME2024, and Omni-math-500. More importantly, we present a simple strategy to examine inference scaling, where increased inference budgets directly lead to T1's better performance without any additional verification. We will open-source the T1 models and the data used to train them at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/T1}.",283275404,60,41,,AIMO

Our recipe for building state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning models relies on three key pillars. First, we create a large-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems, including olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions. Second, we develop a novel method to integrate code execution with long reasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering, resulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions. Third, we create a pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from many candidates. We show that such generative solution selection (GenSelect) can significantly improve upon majority voting baseline. Combining these ideas, we train a series of models that achieve state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Automated systems such as Lean can verify the correctness of proofs written in formal language, yet writing the proofs in formal language can be challenging for humans and machines. The miniF2F benchmark has 20 IMO problems in its testing set, yet formal proofs are available only for 7 of these problems (3 of which are written only by mathematicians). The model with best accuracy can only prove 4 of these 20 IMO problems, from 1950s and 60s, while its training set is a secret. In this work, we write complete, original formal proofs for the remaining 13 IMO problems in Lean along with 3 extra problems from IMO 2022 and 2023. This effort expands the availability of proof currently in the public domain by creating 5,150 lines of Lean proof. The goal of the paper is to pave the way for developing AI models that can automatically write the formal proofs for all the IMO problems in miniF2F and beyond. In this pursuit, we devise a method to decompose the proof of these problems into their building blocks, constructing a dataset of about 900 lemmas with 25,500 lines of Lean code. These lemmas are not trivial, yet they are approachable, providing the opportunity to evaluate and diagnose the failures and successes of AI models. We then evaluate the ability of GPT-4 in writing formal proofs for these lemmas with zero shot prompting, CoT reasoning and lemma retrieval. In evaluating the responses, we also analyze the confounding factor of LLM's ability to write the proofs in natural language vs Lean language.",281879538,7,0,,AIMO

However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches.

However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

Zhang, Weijiang Xu, Xinyu Guan, Buze Zhang, Bingcheng Dong, Xudong Zhou, Bowen Zhang, Ying Xin, Ziming Miao, Scarlett Li, Fan Yang, Mao Yang",arXiv.org,2025,"We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use tasks.

At each step/turn, by leveraging the code execution outputs and programs of previous steps, the model generates the next sub-task and the corresponding program to solve it. This way, SBSC, sequentially navigates to reach the final answer. SBSC allows more granular, flexible and precise approach to problem-solving compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of SBSC in tackling competition and Olympiad-level math problems. For Claude-3.5-Sonnet, we observe SBSC (greedy decoding) surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) program generation based reasoning strategies by absolute 10.7% on AMC12, 8% on AIME and 12.6% on MathOdyssey. Given SBSC is multi-turn in nature, we also benchmark SBSC's greedy decoding against self-consistency decoding results of existing SOTA math reasoning strategies and observe performance gain by absolute 6.2% on AMC, 6.7% on AIME and 7.4% on MathOdyssey.",284961579,3,0,,AIMO

Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang",arXiv.org,2025,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique, and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality, defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving mathematical ability.",289810864,2,38,,AIMO
