2.2 Thermal properties and temperature

PhysicsAndMathsTutor.com

2 A teacher fills a copper can with solid wax and heats the can. She measures the temperature of the wax every minute. She continues heating once the wax has melted and stops heating when the wax is boiling.

(a) (i) State the term used for the process that transfers thermal energy through the copper. [1]
(ii) Fig. 6.1 shows how the temperature of the wax changes as it is heated.

Using the graph in Fig. 6.1, determine:

1. the melting point of the wax  ${ }^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  [1]
2. the boiling point of the wax  ${ }^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  [1]
3. the time at which the wax starts to boil. min [1]
