Fig. 2.1

(a) Hot air blows into the drum. The air gains water vapour from the clothes and then leaves the drum. The moist air enters the condenser. Cool air leaves the condenser, passes through the heating element and enters the drum again.

(i) State the process by which the hot air removes water from the wet clothes. [1]
(ii) The air is cooled as it passes through the condenser.

Describe and explain one other way in which the air leaving the condenser is different from the air entering the condenser.

(b) The drum of the tumble dryer rotates, lifting up the wet clothes which then fall down through the hot air.

(i) Name the force that causes the clothes to fall down. [1]
(ii) When the drum rotates too fast the clothes remain in contact with the wall of the drum. (extended only) State the direction of the resultant force on the clothes during the circular motion. [1]
