10 (b) The mass of water in the bottle is 0.18 kg. The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/(kg °C).

Calculate the thermal energy needed to increase the temperature of the water by 20 °C. (extended only)

thermal energy = [2]

(c) Another plastic bottle is filled to the top with water. The height of the bottle is 40.0 cm. The density of water is 1.0 × 10³ kg/m³. (extended only)

Calculate the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the water.

pressure difference = [2]
