Fig. 4.1

The reading on the thermometer in the water is  $19.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

Only the glass of the lamp is in contact with the water and the electrical connections are completely insulated.

The lamp is switched on.

At the end of the experiment, the temperature of the water is  $21.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

(a) The mass of the water in the beaker is  $600\mathrm{g}$  and the specific heat capacity of water is  $4200\mathrm{J} / (\mathrm{kg}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$

(i) Show that the increase in the internal energy of the water is 6300 J. (extended only)

(ii) In the experiment, the lamp is switched on for 500s. The power supplied to the filament lamp is 13W. The useful energy from the lamp is transferred as light. The energy that increases the temperature of the water is wasted energy. (extended only)

Determine the maximum possible efficiency of the filament lamp.
