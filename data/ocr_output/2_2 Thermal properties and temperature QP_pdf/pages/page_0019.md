The cylinder is placed inside a freezer.

(b) The initial temperature of the cylinder and the gas is  $21^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and, in the freezer, the temperature of the cylinder decreases to  $-18^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . (extended only)

The thermal capacity of the cylinder is  $89\mathrm{J} / {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$

Calculate the change in the internal energy of the cylinder.

change in internal energy  $= \dots$  [2]
