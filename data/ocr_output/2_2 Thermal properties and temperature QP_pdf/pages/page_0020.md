Fig. 5.1

(a) The mass of the block is  $1200\mathrm{kg}$  and it is heated in the furnace from  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $380^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The aluminium block does not melt.

The specific heat capacity of aluminium is  $960\mathrm{J} / (\mathrm{kg}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  (extended only)

Calculate the thermal energy gained by the block in the furnace.

thermal energy = [3]
