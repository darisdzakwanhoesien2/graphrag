Fig. 5.1

Cold water passes over an electric immersion heater inside the tap.

The boiling point of water is  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

(a) State what is meant by boiling point.

[2]

(b) The immersion heater is powered by the mains at a voltage of  $230\mathrm{V}$ . When the tap is opened, the heater switches on and the current in the heater is 13A.

(i) Calculate the thermal energy produced by the heater in 60s.

thermal energy = [2]

(ii) The specific heat capacity of water is  $4200\mathrm{J} / (\mathrm{kg}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . The cold water that enters the tap is at  $22^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . (extended only)

Calculate the rate at which water at its boiling point emerges from the tap.

rate  $= \dots$  [4]
