(b) The value of the heat capacity of the hot junction of a thermocouple thermometer is important in ensuring that it can measure temperature changes very rapidly. (extended only)

Explain why.

(c) The hot junction of a thermocouple thermometer has a heat capacity of  $0.11\mathrm{J} / {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

Calculate the thermal energy required to increase the temperature of the hot junction from  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $345^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . (extended only)
