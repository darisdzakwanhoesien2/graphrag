18 An aluminium saucepan with a plastic handle contains cold water.

Fig. 4.1 shows the saucepan on a hotplate.

(a) State why the pan is made from aluminium but the handle is made from plastic.

[1]

(b) The hotplate is switched on and, as the temperature of the water increases, the internal energy of the water increases.

(i) State, in terms of molecules, what is meant by an increase in internal energy. (extended only)

[1]

(ii) Explain, in terms of the atomic lattice and electrons, how thermal energy is transferred through the aluminium. (extended only)

[3]

(iii) Eventually, the water reaches boiling point. Thermal energy from the hotplate is still being transferred to the water.

Explain, in terms of molecules, the effect of this thermal energy on the water.
