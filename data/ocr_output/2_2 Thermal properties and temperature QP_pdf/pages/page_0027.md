2.2 Thermal properties and temperature

PhysicsAndMathsTutor.com

A large test-tube contains a liquid at room temperature. An electric heater is immersed in the liquid and is switched on. Thermal energy is supplied to the liquid by the heater. The temperature of the liquid increases until it reaches its boiling point. The liquid then starts to change into gas.
3. Explain, in terms of molecules, why a supply of thermal energy is needed to change the liquid into a gas.

The density of the liquid in the test-tube is 0.86 g/cm^{3}. The volume of liquid in the test-tube is 50 cm^{3}.

The liquid reaches its boiling point. It now absorbs 18 000 J of thermal energy and all of the liquid changes into a gas.

Calculate the specific latent heat of vaporisation of this liquid. (extended only)
