21 (a) A solar panel receives energy from the Sun at a rate of $5.0\,\mathrm{kW}$. (extended only)

Thermal energy is transferred from the solar panel to water with an efficiency of $20\%$.

Cold water of mass 15 kg enters the solar panel every hour.

The specific heat capacity of water is $4200\,\mathrm{J/(kg\,^\circ C)}$.

Calculate the temperature increase of the water.

temperature increase = $\mathrm{C}$ [4]
