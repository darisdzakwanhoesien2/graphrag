(b) The Bunsen burner emits infrared waves.

The infrared waves have a wavelength of  $2.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}$ .

The velocity of the infrared waves is  $3.0 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m/s}$ .

(i) Calculate the frequency of the infrared waves.

frequency  $=$  Hz [3]

(ii) State the name of a region of the electromagnetic spectrum which has a wavelength longer than the wavelength of infrared. Give one use of the radiation in this region.
