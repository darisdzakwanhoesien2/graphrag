(a) State one way in which the motion of the particles in ice differs from the motion of the particles in water.

[1]

(b) Energy is transferred from the water to the block of ice.

(i) State the name of the thermal process that transfers energy from the water to the ice.

[1]

(ii) Initially, there is  $0.34\mathrm{kg}$  of water in the beaker. The specific heat capacity of water is  $4200\mathrm{J} / (\mathrm{kg}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . (extended only)

Calculate the energy transferred from this water as its temperature decreases from  $28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

energy transferred  $= \dots$  [2]

(iii) The temperature of the water near the ice decreases first.

Explain how convection causes the temperature of all the water in the beaker to decrease.

[3]

(iv) State what happens to the internal energy of the water as the temperature of the water decreases. (extended only)

Describe the change in terms of the energy of the particles.
