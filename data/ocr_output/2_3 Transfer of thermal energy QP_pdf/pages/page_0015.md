Fig. 5.1

The heater is at a very high temperature and it glows red. The manufacturer states:

"The heater emits light and radiation and it transfers thermal energy by radiation."

(a) State the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that transfers thermal energy. [1]
(b) State:

(i) one way in which visible light and the radiation identified in (a) are similar [1]
(ii) one way in which visible light differs from the radiation identified in (a). [1]
