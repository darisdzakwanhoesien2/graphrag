Fig. 5.2a shows the cup with the hot drink and a holder for the sides of the cup.
Fig. 5.2b shows a cross-section through the holder. The holder is made from two strong paper cylinders separated by a wavy piece of strong paper to make air gaps.

Explain how using the holder makes it more comfortable to hold the cup.

(b) A student carries out experiments on the cooling of the hot drink described in (a), with and without the holder in place. He finds that the holder only reduces the rate of cooling slightly.

Suggest and explain another action that reduces the rate of cooling more effectively.
