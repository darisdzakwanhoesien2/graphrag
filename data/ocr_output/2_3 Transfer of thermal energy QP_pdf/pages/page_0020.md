2.3 Transfer of thermal energy

PhysicsAndMathsTutor.com

19 A metal container is used to cook food. The metal container has thick walls. Hot cooking oil at a temperature of  $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  is poured into the container.

(a) The outside surface of the container gets hot. Some thermal energy passes through the metal because vibrating atoms in the metal collide with neighbouring atoms and transfer energy to them. (extended only)

Explain how the rest of the thermal energy is conducted through the metal container to the outside surface by another process.

[3]

(b) The outside surface of the container is brightly polished and shiny.

Explain how this reduces the power that needs to be supplied to keep the oil at the correct temperature.

(c) The metal container is spherical. The spherical container has a smaller surface area than a long, thin container of the same volume. (extended only)

Explain the advantage of using a spherical container.
